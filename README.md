### Introduction
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is an indicator of downside risk, with large MDDs suggesting that down movements could be volatile. However, while MDD measures the most significant loss, it does not account for the frequency of losses and the size of any gains.

#### What can you do with a maximum drawdown?

MDD can be used to measure the risk of losing money from the portfolio performance as it is the most negative cumulative return over a given time period. In other terms, it is the maximum percentage loss that occurred in a return data series, measured as the worst period of "peak to valley" performance for the fund, regardless of whether the drawdown consisted of consecutive months of negative performance. The maximum drawdown is based on simple returns.
